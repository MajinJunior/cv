    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a first-generation graduate from the University of Houston. I received my Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering in May 2021 with a concentraion in computers
      and embedded systems, as well as a minor in mathematics. Shortly after graduation I was offered a job as an electrical and software engineer at a small oil and gas company in Houston, TX
      that specializes in making testing equipment for oil and gas companies. I have been working at OFI Testing Equipment for about 10 months now. Being a small company with only myself and my manager,
      Doan Ho, as the sole electrical engineers I have had to wear lots of hats in my work and as such have learned a lot in my short time here. Thus far I have become a better programmer,
      learned ladder logic and plc programming, controls/PID design and tuning, electrical wiring, schematic drawing in Autocad Electrical, HMI/GUI design and embedded systems programming, many communication protocols such as modbus,
      uart, spi, i2c, rs485, tcp. Currently I am learning pcb design in Altium Designer and contiuning work in programming an emdedded touch screen module to serve as a temperature controller/HMI for one
      of our products. In the near future I am looking forward to learning LabView programming, iOS and Android app development, and anything else I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work I am currently tackling a Udemy Web Dev course to become a better programmer, and become more versed with all levels of the stack. I am most familiar with back-end development so by the time
      I am done with this course I want to be a worthy full-stack developer.
